 * It includes following parts: 
 * Process ID (Process unique ID)，
 * Process name (The same as the program name, which might be the same as the other process)          
 * Process state (such as waiting, running or finished)
 * Arrive time (The process preparing finished time)
 * Run time (How much time the process cost)
 * Start time (time when process start to run)
 * End Time (time when process end to run)
 * Priority (the priority of processes)
